# Evaluating and Improving Defenses with MITRE ATT&CK

This repository contains the ATT&CK Navigator matrices for the threats discussed in [Breakout BRKSEC-2227 "ATT&CKing Our Own Defenses (Before Someone Else Does)"](https://www.ciscolive.com/global/learn/session-catalog.html?search=BRKSEC-2227#/). This session is being delivered at Cisco Live US in Las Vegas on June 1st, 2026.

Additional files will be included in the installation of the attack_gap_analysis tool from Github. This will also include more source JSONs and the example YAML files for DeTTECT.

## Related Tools
I am also using some additional tools in the presentation that can be obtained via the following repos:

## McPhee projects in support:
I have done some light vibe-coding to build tools that help accelerate use of ATT&CK in providing gap analysis or understanding how the many projects in the ecosystem fit:
- [ATT&CK Parser](https://github.com/mjmcphee/attack_parser)
- [ATT&CK Rosetta](https://github.com/mjmcphee/attack-rosetta)
- [Gap Analysis Playbook](https://github.com/mjmcphee/attack_gap_analysis)
- [SANS Reading Room Gold Paper: "Methods to Employ Zeek in Detecting MITRE ATT&CK Techniques"](https://www.sans.edu/cyber-research/39675/)


## To use:
Clone the repo as needed for ready access to the examples worked on in BRKSEC-2227.

Specific instructions for the Related Tools are offered in each repository.
